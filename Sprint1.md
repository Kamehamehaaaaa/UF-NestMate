## Issues Not Completed and Reasons

1. Apartment filters not implemented: We were focused on familiarizing ourselves with React and frontend development, delaying the implementation of apartment filters for sorting based on user preferences. This will be prioritized in the next sprint.
2. Apartment cards not fully functional: While apartment cards were developed with essential details like name, pincode, and rating, they are not yet clickable. The goal for the next sprint is to enable a pop-up displaying detailed information, including user reviews and ratings.
3. Apartment Review summarizer: An automatic summarizer which summarizes reviews which will help the user to get an overview of the apartment.
4. Frontend- Backend Integration: Currently frontend-backend are two separate entites and need to be integrated and thorough integration testing is required
