# Sprint 2

## Issues Completed
1. Integration of frontend and backend, using apis to carryout neccessary functionality.
2. Added apis for comments on apartments with ratings on the apartment.
3. A user profile section for users to manage the user information.
4. Contact form functionality for users to connect with apartment representatives for queries.
5. Using my sql database for data storing operations.
6. Apartment cards to display all the apartments in the area.

## Issues Not Completed and Reasons

1. Apartment filters not implemented: The backend support for apartment filters is still being worked on. This will be completed by first half of next sprint.
